Responsive Mockup
<br>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>The first release of the Two Dogs site includes several vital features which are detailed below. Future releases should include additional features as outlined in the 'Features Left to Implement' section below.</p>
<br>

<h3>Existing Features</h3>
<strong>The navigation bar</strong>
<p>Featured on all pages, this fully responsive navigation includes links to the landing page, the meet page, the tails blog page, the gallery and the blog sign up page. It is exactly replicated across the site to ensure consistency for the user.</p>

<p>The navigation allows users to browse the site from any page without having to use the back button on their device.</p>

<strong>The landing page hero image</strong>
<p>The landing page opens up to an image of the two dogs, enticing the user to explore the site further and find out more about them. The image has a slight zoom to help focus the user on the call-to-action, beginning their journey on the site.</p>

<h3>Features Left to Implement</h3>
<ul>
    <li>CMS for adding and organising blog posts and image/video content</li>
    <li>Automated emails to subscribed users with optional daily, weekly or monthly updates</li>
    <li>Comments and social sharing on blog posts</li>
    <li>Option to implement dynamic image sizes at different screen sizes</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>Throughout the development of this site, testing was carried out on different devices using the developer tools on multiple browsers including Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge on Windows 10.</p>

<p>This was repeated at the final testing phase of the project using the free testing variations on <a href="https://live.browserstack.com/dashboard">BrowserStack.com</a>, while extending the reach of testing to other Windows OS, the broswer Safari and multiple MacOS. It is worth noting that as this is a free tool, the accuracy of the tests may be limited.</p>

<p>For all testing, each page was reviewed across the following criteria;
<ul>
    <li>Layout and positioning (ie is everything where it's expected to be on all devices)</li>
    <li>Functions (ie buttons, links, inputs, etc)</li>
    <li>Features (ie image rendering, form fill and submission, etc)</li>
    <li>Consistency, convention and expectation (ie does it allow affordance to the user)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Additionally, the sight was evaluated by Google's Lighthouse and Page Speed tools. The results were as follows.</p>

<strong>Lighthouse</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Performance - </li>
    <li>Accessibility - </li>
    <li>Best Practices - </li>
    <li>SEO - </li>
</ul>
<br>

<strong>Page Speed</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Mobile - </li>
    <li>Desktop - </li>
</ul>
<br>

<h3>Validator Testing</h3>
<p>
During initial testing, opportunity to refactor the code were dicovered and an attempt was made to improve it. This resulted in larger changes than expected, such as the move to using styled sections over individually targeted elements, which required additional fixes and further testing before release.</p>
<br>

<strong>HTML</strong>
<p>In the first round of html validator testing, button tags and section/article tags were found to be used incorrectly. In addition, there were a small number of open and unnecessary tags that needed to be addressed.</p>

<p>**The second round, conducted after implementing the new structure, found a open div on the index page, sections incorrectly used in place of divs and some stray tags. In two instances, changing the section to div required updating the css file to maintain syles.</p>

<p>The third and final round returned no errors for this project.</p>
<br>

<strong>CSS</strong>
<p>In the first round of css validator testing, some unclosed attributes were found. This highlighted that these attributes were unecessary to the output of the code and were removed.</p>

<p>**The second round, conducted after implementing more efficient css, found two parse errors. In addition, it warned of the use of the deprecated property 'clip'.</p>

<p>The third and final round returned no errors for this project.</p>
<br>

<h2>Unfixed Bugs</h2>
<strong>404 Error</strong>
<p>Due to the limitations of GitHub, a custom 404 page has not been implemented. However, the page has been developed along side the project oin this release and should be implemented when applicable.</p>
<br>

<strong>Browser Discrepencies</strong>
<p>On both Firefox and Safari, the redirect to the custom success page after submitting the sign up form is broken. The user is brough to the Code Institute 'form dump' confirmation page.</p>
<br>

<p>Also Firefox and Safari, the custom styling on the sign up form is not displaying as expected and is overwritten by browser defaults. Although this does not interfere with the user experience, it does effect the brand and site consistency.</p>
<br>

<h2>Deployment</h2>
<p>**This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)
**The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
**In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
 **From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
**Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
