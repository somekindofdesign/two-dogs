**For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

**In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

<h3>Features Left to Implement</h3>
<ul>
    <li>CMS for adding and organising blog posts and image/video content</li>
    <li>Automated emails to subscribed users with optional daily, weekly or monthly updates</li>
    <li>Comments and social sharing on blogs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Testing</h2>
**In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your project’s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.
**In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
**You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
**If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

<h3>Validator Testing</h3>
<strong>HTML</strong>
In the first round of validator testing, button tags and section/article tags were found to be used incorrectly. In addition, there were a small number of open tags and unnecessary tags that needed to be addressed. 

<strong>CSS</strong>
**No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator

<h2>Unfixed Bugs</h2>
**You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

<h2>Deployment</h2>
**This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)
**The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
**In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
**From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
**Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
