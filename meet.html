        <h2>Meet the Two Dogs</h2>
        <p>These Two Dogs are pretty special. Both had rough starts in life but now live the doggy dream with their two pals Andrew and Louise.</p>
        <p>Eric was the first to join the family. He was rescued in 2015 in a group of 18 dogs suffering from severe neglect. Being the runt, he was dominated by the others and was in such bad condition the vet considered euthanasia. Luckily, Andrew met him and knew he could help.</p>
        <p>Jim came next. He was picked up off the side of a motorway with his mother, brother and sisters in 2016. Only a few weeks old, the pups were starving and barely alive. Huskies are a commonly abandoned breed so rehoming them was a difficult task but luckily Andrew and Louise knew Jim would always be welcome.</p>
        <p>Theyâ€™ve had some tough times but these days they are both happy and healthy with daily runs, lots of play and better food than most people!</p>
