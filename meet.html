        <h2>These two are pretty special</h2>
        <p>Eric was rescued in 2015 suffering from severe neglect. He was in such bad condition the vet considered euthanasia. Luckily, Andrew met him and knew he could help Eric.</p>
        <p>Jim was picked up off the side of a motorway with his mother and siblings in 2016. Only a few weeks old, the pups were starving and barely alive. Permanently rehoming huskies is a difficult task but luckily Andrew and Louise knew Jim would always be welcome.</p>
        <p>These days they are both happy and healthy with daily runs, lots of play and too many treats!</p>
