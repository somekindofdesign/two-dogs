        <p><strong>We regularly get odd reactions from people seeing Eric for the first time but this is my absolute favourite.</strong></p>
        <p>It was a lovely brisk and bright day before Jim joined the family. We decided to take Eric for a long walk up to the Wicklow mountains for a big walk.</p>
        <p>After climbing a patularly steep part of the hill, we sat on a rock to rest. Eric turns into a different dog in the wilderness, all that seclusion brings out his deeply buried instincts so he runs and runs and runs. So he had no clothes on, he was nude except for his harness.</p>
        <p>As we rested, we saw a hiking group stop nearby us, also to rest. All good so far.</p>
        <p>All of a sudden one of the group leaps up and begins to storm towards us, looking pretty upset.</p>
        <div class="img-text">
            <img src="/assets/images/two_chinese_crested_sun.jpg" alt="two chinese crested dogs lying together in the sun">
            <p>At first we didn't think he was headed to us. Eric was on a lead, we were minding our business. But he was headed towards us, still looking pretty determined.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Then he stops about 10 feet from where we were sitting and roars, "For f*ck sake, I thought you had a nakes child on a lead!"</p>
        <p>I don't think either of us could speak to that poor man we were laughing so much! He just turned tail and went abck to his group without a word.</p>
        <p>We were still laughing as he went.</p>
